Spring Boot and React CRUD Application
This is a README file for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Spring Boot and React. This application demonstrates the integration of a backend API built with Spring Boot and a frontend user interface developed with React. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a specific resource.

Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 8 or higher
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment), such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
PostgreSQL or any other relational database management system (RDBMS)
Getting Started
To get started with the Spring Boot and React CRUD application, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository or download the source code.

git clone https://github.com/KostasTheG/Final_Project.git

Backend Setup

Open the backend project in your IDE.
Configure the database connection settings in the application.properties file.
Run the Spring Boot application to start the backend server.
Frontend Setup

Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend project directory.
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

npm install


Once the dependencies are installed, start the React development server with the following command:

npm start

Access the Application

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the React application.
The application will allow you to perform CRUD operations on the specified resource.
Folder Structure
The project structure of the Spring Boot and React CRUD application may look as follows:

spring-boot-react-crud/
├── backend/                 # Backend Spring Boot project
│   ├── src/
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── ...
└── frontend/                # Frontend React project
    ├── src/
    ├── public/
    ├── package.json
    └── ...


The backend folder contains the Spring Boot application source code and configuration files.
The frontend folder contains the React application source code, public assets, and package configuration.
Additional Notes
The backend API endpoints can be defined in the Spring Boot controllers.
The frontend React components can be modified in the React application's source code.
Make sure to update the database configuration in the backend application according to your setup.
Customize the frontend user interface as per your requirements using React components, styles, and routing.
